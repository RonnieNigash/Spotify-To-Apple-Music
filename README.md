Transitioning playlists from Spotify to Apple Music

## Update
Apparently iTunes 12.2 does not allow for API calls to Apple Music library as opposed to tracks in local library. Cannot search for streaming songs, script can only search through current.

Script will iterate through playlists and add the track names and artists to a .txt file, then take this collection of codified playlists to Apple Music to rebuild playlists
